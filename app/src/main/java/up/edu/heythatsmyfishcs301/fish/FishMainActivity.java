 * Hey That's My Fish CS 301 (University of Portland)

 *
 * STATUS OF OUR GAME (FINAL RELEASE) (12/3/20):
 *
 * Since the Beta release we have added the following features to our game:
 *  1. When the game first starts up music plays (ClubPenguin Pizza Parlor Theme)
 *      a. When the restart button is pressed it stops playing and restarts playing the theme too
 *      b. A "Mute/Unmute" button was added to the game which allows the user to turn on or off
 *         the music whenever they want to! :) Depending on if it's muted or not the text of the
 *         button changes to either "Mute" or "Unmute".
 *  2. Tiles that a player can either place their penguin on, or move to are highlighted yellow.
 *  3. Displays each players name on the board above the pieces they own.
 *  4. Added sound effects when a player:
 *      a. Is taken out of the game (has no valid moves left)
 *      b. Wins the game (wow sound effect)
 *
 *
 * Known Bugs:
 *
 *  We still haven't been able to figure out how to prevent the game from crashing when it is
 *  restarted multiple times on the ASUS tablets. This was a bug previously stated in our Beta
 *  release. (Refer to GitHub issues page for error. "BitMap Resources causing memory overload")
 *
 *  Restart button appears elongated vertically on a mobile phone (doesn't happen on any of the
 *  tablets we've tested however).
 *

/**
 * STATUS OF OUR GAME (As of the BETA RELEASE) (11/24/20) :
 * The game is fully functional, and supporst all the rules of play we committed to implement in our
 * requirements. It is possible to play with any combination of players allowed by the requirements
 * and the rules of play.
 *
 * All functionality of the GUI we specified in our requirements.
 *
 * Our "smart" and our "dumb" AI are also fully implemented. Our dumb AI when placing its penguins
 * places them on the first tile it sees has one fish. When it moves its penguin it just moves to
 * the next spot it sees that is valid, meaning there is a straight path to the tile and it isn't
 * being obstructed by another penguin. Our "smart" AI has improved its placing action by randomly
 * placing its pieces on any tile that has one fish. This spreads out the AI's pieces so that it can
 * cover more ground and potentially get a higher score. It's move action is improved because it
 * uses the same search algorithm to find a valid place but what differs from the "dumb" AI is that
 * it searches each direction it can move and if that direction has a tile with 3 fish it moves there
 * first to get the most score. If there aren't any 3 fish it can move to it checks to see if there
 * are 2 fish, then 1 fish. We have seen in tests that on average the smart player scores more due
 * to the improvements we've made
 *
 * All graphic elements are complete and in their final form. All final versions of our penguins and
 * fishTiles are complete.
 *
 * THe GUI is also effective and functional :)
 *
 * We conducted a breadth of tests along with multiple edge case tests and have conlcuded that our
 * game has a few bugs that we know of one of which is that, if the human player loses or wins,
 * their penguins don't get redrawn to the side of the GUI. However this doesn't affect gameplay and
 * is still fully functional with this in the game still. Another bug is that when run on the ASUS
 * tablets if you restart the game multiple times it crashes. We have found this is due to the fact
 * that we have a lot of bitmaps in our project which use a lot of memory. This is causing an out
 * of memory error (~2GB of memory used).
